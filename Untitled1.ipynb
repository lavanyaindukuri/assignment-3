    "A. global scope,local scope ,enclosing scope and build in scope .Local scope is limited to the function where it is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "A. the local variables are destroyed when the function terminates and are then recreated when the function starts again.\n",
